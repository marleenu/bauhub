# Random project
This is a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) project.
It's the first home assignment I ever did, and later I refactored it and added Redux store and DnD handler to play around a bit. No emphasis has been put on the style/UX, this project is just a playground for myself. 

## Run

Clone the repository and run:
`npm install`.

Start the server:
`npm start`

Project will start on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000),
Concurrently, json-server will run on port 3333 and serve the mock api on [http://localhost:3333/list](http://localhost:3333/list).

To start the project without serving the mock api, run `npm start 3000`.

### Mock server

This project uses [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
